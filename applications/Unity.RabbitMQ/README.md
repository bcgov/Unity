# Unity RabbitMQ

Setup of RabbitMQ message broker in an OpenShift container requires an administrator user (`unity-admin`) and two client users each associated with their own virtual hosts (`/dev` and `/dev2`).

## Prerequisites

- OpenShift cluster access
- RabbitMQ installed on your OpenShift cluster
- RabbitMQ CLI tools (`rabbitmqctl`)

## Setup

### Creating Virtual Hosts

To create the virtual hosts `/dev` and `/dev2`, use the following commands:

```sh
rabbitmqctl add_vhost /dev
rabbitmqctl add_vhost /dev2
```

### Adding Users and Setting Permissions

Create the administrator user `unity-admin`:

```sh
rabbitmqctl add_user unity-admin 'your_admin_password'
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / unity-admin ".*" ".*" ".*"
rabbitmqctl set_user_tags unity-admin administrator
```

Create the client user `unity-rabbitmq-user-dev` for the `/dev` vhost:

```sh
rabbitmqctl add_user unity-rabbitmq-user-dev 'your_dev_password'
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /dev unity-rabbitmq-user-dev ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

Create the client user `unity-rabbitmq-user-dev2` for the `/dev2` vhost:

```sh
rabbitmqctl add_user unity-rabbitmq-user-dev2 'your_dev2_password'
rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /dev2 unity-rabbitmq-user-dev2 ".*" ".*" ".*"
```

## Volume Mounts

To persist RabbitMQ data a container volume mount is required with backup to offsite S3 storage.

```yaml
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /var/lib/rabbitmq
```
